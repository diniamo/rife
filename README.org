* Rife

CLI tool to watch local media with others. Handles both streaming and synchronization.

** Usage

Important: the TCP ports *5300* and *5301* must point to the host's computer. This means that
- if the host and the clients are on different networks, the most forward the ports in their NAT
- if the host has a firewall, the ports must be opened there

To host a file, simply use the ~server~ subcommand, and pass the path:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
rife host <file>
#+END_SRC

Then on the other end, run:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
rife connect <address>
#+END_SRC
where address is that of the host, without a port number.

** Building / Running

To build, run the following command:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
go build ./cmd/rife
#+END_SRC

To run, run the resulting executable, or:
#+BEGIN_SRC shell
go run ./cmd/rife ...
#+END_SRC
