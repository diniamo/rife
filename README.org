* Strim

CLI tool to watch local media with others. Handles both streaming and synchronization.

** Building / Running

~go build~ or ~go run~ the ~./cmd/strim~ package.

** Usage

Important: the TCP port *5300* must point to the host's computer. This means that if the host and the clients are on different networks,
- the host must /forward the port/ in their NAT, and open it in their firewall
- or all participants must be on the same /virtual private network/

Run ~strim --help~ or ~strim <subcommand> --help~ for usage information.
